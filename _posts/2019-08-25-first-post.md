For the past couple years, I've always wanted to start a blog.  Now I have one!  It took me years and years to finally get around to doing this.  I've spent countless hours reading peoples blogs that I look up to, so I hope I can pay it forward.

I know for sure I'm going to be posting tech stuff here, and I'll probably throw in some non-tech stuff occasionally.  I have just way too many hobbies not to.

Check out my about me page for my bio, and the links at the bottom of the page for my LinkedIn, Github, and Twitter (something I really need to do more of) accounts.
