Howdy!  My name is Ryan Baker, and welcome to my blog!  For as long as I can remember, it's been my goal to start a public blog and finally I've made it a reality.  My goal is to populate it with great content to help people like myself, whether that's learning or simply knowing they are not alone in the never ending world of change in the software and infrastructure world.

# Bio

I grew up in the small town of Lyndon, Kansas with a graduating class of 36.  I'll never forget a certain day in second grade when I found a book in the library on BASIC programming.  We had just gotten our first family computer and at the age of 8, I worked through the entire book over the course of the summer (sorry Mrs. Hurt for stealing that book, I really wish I still had it!), and wrote my own text driven "Chose your own adventure" game, similar to Zork. I was hooked, and the journey began.

# Presentations

One of my favorite things to do is to share knowledge and experiences with the community!  Check out a few of the presentations I've done at public conferences.
